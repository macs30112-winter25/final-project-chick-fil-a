# The Spatial Distribution of Open-Source AI: Regional Patterns of Innovation and Participation in the U.S. - Group Chick-Fil-A
## Project Goals
This study examines the geographic distribution of open-source AI research in the U.S. and its relationship with economic development and higher education resources. Using GitHub repositories tagged with “AI” and sorted by popularity, we will extract geographic data from top contributors, leveraging the number of stars as a measure of engagement. We will geocode user locations through GitHub profiles, Bing Maps API, and university email domains, aiming for a dataset of at least 5,000 users. Through data visualization, we will analyze AI participation at city and state levels, correlating it with macroeconomic indicators such as GDP and higher education presence. Finally, we will compare AI engagement with the broader open-source ecosystem to assess diffusion and potential disparities.
## Research Question
- **Top Contributing Regions**: Which U.S. cities or states contribute the most to AI-related open-source projects?
- **Role of Economic Development and Higher Education**: How does economic development or the density of higher education institutions explain these geographic patterns?
- **Comparison with AI Industry Clustering**: Is AI open-source development more geographically decentralized compared to AI companies and R&D centers?
